    "## Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "During the COVID-19 pandemic, given that the most effective vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna) required a two-doses to be effective, governments around the world came up with different dose scheduling strategies to vaccinate their populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Canadian policy](https://covid19tracker.ca/vaccinationtracker.html) was to prime most people with a first dose, and once a sufficient portion of the population was primed, only then to rollout the second dose. The aim was to provide partial immunity to as many people as possible, as opposed to providing ‘full’ immunity to a subset of the population. *I call this vaccination strategy A.*\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the USA and most other countries took the second route, which was to prime all their people with a first dose and follow up with a second dose immediately upon the end of the priming period (21-28 days). *I call this vaccination strategy B.*\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, people around the world were self-isolating, distancing and masking themselves to prevent disease spread through contact.\n",
    "\n",
    "My goal for the project was to simulate the disease spread given these distinct distribution strategies. I asked 2 questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which vaccination strategy is ‘better’ when coupled with distancing behaviours? (As I will see, ‘better’ can mean different things.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Do distancing behaviors really slow spread?"

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Individuals in a population are mobile. When infected individuals carrying the pathogen move around and come into contact with susceptible individuals who are also mobile, transmission occurs and the disease spreads.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the population level, this type of spread can be mathematically modelled by a compartmental model characterized by an initial value problem. In 1927, Kermack and McKendrick put forth as a series of ordinary differential equations describing a special case of disease spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "This special case became a classic compartmental model for the spread of infectious disease, known today as the SIR model, where individuals progress unidirectionally between three states (compartments) – susceptible (S), infectious (I) and removed (R)–depending on their interactions with other individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![In the SIR model individuals move unidirectionally from the S, to the I and to the R compartments.](images/SIR_diagram.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "When a susceptible individual comes into contact with an infectious individual, and disease transmission occurs between them, the susceptible is re-assigned into the infectious compartment. Now, this person may infect further susceptible individuals they come into contact with. When an infectious person recovers or dies, that person is re-assigned to the removed (recovered) compartment, and conferred immunity against the disease. This person may not get re-infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, as the epidemic progresses, the number of susceptible individuals declines, the number of removed individuals increases, and transmission rates decrease. This shifting distribution of the population is responsible for the end of the epidemic."

    "## My Model—SEIRV\n",
    "\n",
    "I modified the SIR model as depicted in the chart below. \n",
    "\n",
    "In my version, when a susceptible individual contracts the pathogen from an infected individual, they are not immediately infectious themselves. They undergo a short incubation period, during which they are assigned to the ‘exposed’ compartment. *(infected ≠ infectious)*\n",
    "\n",
    "I also added a two-dose vaccine to the scenario. If a susceptible individual is vaccinated with a first dose (primed), they gain partial immunity to the disease-causing agent. This means that if they come into contact with an infectious individual, the probability of disease transmission will be lower than if they were unvaccinated (susceptible).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the primed individual receives the second dose of the vaccine, they gain complete immunity and move to the removed (recovered) compartment directly, thereby reducing the number of susceptible individuals in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "![My modified model including vaccinations and an incubation period](images/SEIRV_diagram.png \"I modified the SIR model to include an incubation period and a two-step vaccination course.\")\n",
    "\n",
    "If a susceptible individual is vaccinated with a first dose (primed), they gain partial immunity to the disease-causing agent. This means that if they come into contact with an infectious individual, the probability of disease transmission will be lower than if they were unvaccinated (susceptible).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the primed individual receives the second dose of the vaccine, they gain complete immunity and move to the removed (recovered) compartment directly, thereby reducing the number of susceptible individuals in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, this model is a simplification—in a real epidemic, individuals do not move unidirectionally between compartments, and vaccines are not 100% effective. I've attached a list of assumptions in an appendix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels on the arrows in the diagram represent the rates of movement of individuals from one compartment to the next. Please refer to the appendix for transition rate derivations. Notations are defined in the table below."
